                        <p>At Vigor Tech, we don&apos;t build for the sake of building. Every tool, system, and platform we develop starts with a clear question: What real problem are we solving? We believe technology should be intentional, inclusive, and impactful.</p>

                        <p>From the ground up, our solutions are designed to create access where there was none, streamline systems that were once broken, and empower users who&apos;ve often been overlooked. We&apos;re not in the business of trendsâ€”we&apos;re in the business of transformation.</p>
